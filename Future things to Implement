Add the ability for users to add their own drinks. This may need the help of firebase. Maybe have two databases and the firebase one pushes to MYSQL at odd hours of the day?

look into PHPADMIN instead for database usage
- downloaded and configuring phpMyAdmin. Hopefully it works better. 
- downloaded XAMPP which comes with PhPMyAdmin and also MySQL server. Much better package to install and also has Apache. This should do the trick for the database. 
- code snippet to connect to mysql database for later use: 
	<?php

	/*** mysql hostname ***/
	$hostname = 'localhost';

	/*** mysql username ***/
	$username = 'username';

	/*** mysql password ***/
	$password = 'password';

	try {
		$dbh = new PDO("mysql:host=$hostname;dbname=mysql", $username, $password);
		/*** echo a message saying we have connected ***/
		echo 'Connected to database';
		}
	catch(PDOException $e)
		{
		echo $e->getMessage();
		}
	?>
